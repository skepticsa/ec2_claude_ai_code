Execute a controlled deployment process with automatic rollback on failure:

1. Deployment Phase:
   - Run the command: 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
   - Capture and display the complete command output
   - If deployment succeeds, proceed to step 3
   - If deployment fails, proceed to step 2

2. Rollback Phase (on failure):
   - Document the specific errors that caused the deployment to fail
   - Run the command: 'terraform destroy -auto-approve'
   - Verify that all resources have been successfully destroyed
   - Make necessary corrections to address the identified errors
   - Return to step 1 to attempt deployment again

3. Success Confirmation:
   - When deployment succeeds, display the complete output including all created resources
   - Provide a summary of any errors encountered during previous attempts and how they were resolved
   - Confirm that all specified infrastructure has been properly deployed

Critical Requirements:
- Execute Terraform commands sequentially, never in parallel
- Wait for each command to fully complete before proceeding
- Maintain a single Terraform process/thread at all times
- Document each deployment attempt with timestamps
- Keep track of all errors and their resolutions
- Continue the deployment-rollback cycle until successful deployment is achieved

Present a final deployment report including successful resource creation outputs and connection information.
