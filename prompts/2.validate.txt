Execute an iterative validation process for the Terraform code:

1. First, run 'terraform validate' to check the syntax and configuration
   - If validation passes, proceed to step 2
   - If validation fails, analyze each error message carefully
   - Make specific corrections to address each validation error
   - Document what changes were made and why
   - Run 'terraform validate' again until it passes

2. Once validation passes, run 'terraform plan' to preview the infrastructure changes
   - If the plan succeeds without errors, display the complete plan output
   - If the plan fails, identify and fix each error in the code
   - Document what changes were made to fix each plan error
   - Run 'terraform validate' followed by 'terraform plan' again

3. Important execution rules:
   - Execute only one Terraform command at a time
   - Always show the full command output for debugging purposes
   - Continue this validation-fix-revalidate loop until both commands execute successfully
   - Maintain a running log of all errors encountered and how they were resolved
   - Ensure each fix is minimal and targeted to the specific error

Present the final validated and successfully planned Terraform configuration along with a summary of any corrections made during the process.
