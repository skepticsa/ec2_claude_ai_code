Perform an iterative security compliance assessment and remediation process:

1. Security Scanning Phase:
   - Run the command: 'checkov -d . --framework terraform'
   - Capture and display the complete scan output including:
     * Total number of failed checks
     * Failed check IDs and descriptions
     * Resource paths with security issues
     * Severity levels of each finding

2. Analysis and Remediation Phase:
   - Prioritize findings by severity (High → Medium → Low)
   - For each security issue identified:
     * Document the specific security concern
     * Explain the potential risk/impact
     * Implement the appropriate fix in the Terraform code
     * Comment the code with the rationale for the change

3. Verification Phase:
   - Run Checkov again with the same parameters
   - Confirm that previously identified issues are resolved
   - If new issues are detected, return to step 2
   - If issues remain, continue remediation until all are resolved

4. Compliance Documentation:
   - When all security checks pass, provide a comprehensive report including:
     * Summary of all issues that were fixed
     * Security best practices implemented
     * Compliance standards now met (e.g., CIS, AWS Well-Architected)
     * Any intentional exceptions with justification

Technical Execution Requirements:
- Execute only one Checkov scan at a time
- Allow each scan to fully complete before initiating analysis
- Maintain a sequential workflow throughout the entire process
- Document all changes made to remediate security findings
- Continue the scan-fix-verify cycle until zero security issues remain

Present the final secure Terraform configuration with documentation of all security improvements made.
